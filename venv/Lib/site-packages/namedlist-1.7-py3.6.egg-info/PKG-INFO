        Overview
        ========
        
        namedlist provides 2 factory functions, namedlist.namedlist and
        namedlist.namedtuple. namedlist.namedtuple is similar to
        collections.namedtuple, with the following differences:
        
        * namedlist.namedtuple supports per-field default values.
        
        * namedlist.namedtuple supports an optional default value, to be used
          by all fields that do not have an explicit default value.
        
        
        namedlist.namedlist is similar, with this additional difference:
        
        * namedlist.namedlist instances are mutable.
        
        Typical usage
        =============
        
        You can use namedlist like a mutable namedtuple::
        
            >>> from namedlist import namedlist
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y')
            >>> p = Point(1, 3)
            >>> p.x = 2
            >>> assert p.x == 2
            >>> assert p.y == 3
        
        Or, you can specify a default value for all fields::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y', default=3)
            >>> p = Point(y=2)
            >>> assert p.x == 3
            >>> assert p.y == 2
        
        Or, you can specify per-field default values::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', [('x', 0), ('y', 100)])
            >>> p = Point()
            >>> assert p.x == 0
            >>> assert p.y == 100
        
        You can also specify the per-field defaults with a mapping, instead
        of an iterable. Note that this is only useful with an ordered
        mapping, such as an OrderedDict::
        
            >>> from collections import OrderedDict
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', OrderedDict((('y', 0),
            ...                                         ('x', 100))))
            >>> p = Point()
            >>> p
            Point(y=0, x=100)
        
        The default value will only be used if it is provided and a per-field
        default is not used::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', ['x', ('y', 100)], default=10)
            >>> p = Point()
            >>> assert p.x == 10
            >>> assert p.y == 100
        
        If you use a mapping, the value NO_DEFAULT is convenient to specify
        that a field uses the default value::
        
            >>> from namedlist import NO_DEFAULT
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', OrderedDict((('y', NO_DEFAULT),
            ...                                         ('x', 100))),
            ...                            default=5)
            >>> p = Point()
            >>> assert p.x == 100
            >>> assert p.y == 5
        
        namedtuple is similar, except the instances are immutable::
        
            >>> from namedlist import namedtuple
            >>> Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y', default=3)
            >>> p = Point(y=2)
            >>> assert p.x == 3
            >>> assert p.y == 2
            >>> p.x = 10
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AttributeError: can't set attribute
        
        All of the documentation below in the Specifying Fields and Specifying
        Defaults sections applies to namedlist.namedlist and
        namedlist.namedtuple.
        
        Creating types
        ==============
        
        Specifying Fields
        -----------------
        
        Fields in namedlist.namedlist or namedlist.namedtuple can be specified
        as in collections.namedtuple: as either a string specifing the field
        names, or as a iterable of field names. These two uses are
        equivalent::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y')
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', ['x', 'y'])
        
        As are these::
        
            >>> Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
            >>> Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
        
        If using a string, commas are first converted to spaces. So these are
        equivalent::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y')
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x,y')
        
        
        Specifying Defaults
        -------------------
        
        Per-field defaults can be specified by supplying a 2-tuple (name,
        default_value) instead of just a string for the field name. This is
        only supported when you specify a list of field names::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', [('x', 0), ('y', 0)])
            >>> p = Point(3)
            >>> assert p.x == 3
            >>> assert p.y == 0
        
        Or, using namedtuple::
        
            >>> Point = namedtuple('Point', [('x', 0), ('y', 0)])
            >>> p = Point(3)
            >>> assert p.x == 3
            >>> assert p.y == 0
        
        
        In addition to, or instead of, these per-field defaults, you can also
        specify a default value which is used when no per-field default value
        is specified::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y z', default=0)
            >>> p = Point(y=3)
            >>> assert p.x == 0
            >>> assert p.y == 3
            >>> assert p.z == 0
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', [('x', 0), 'y', ('z', 0)], default=4)
            >>> p = Point(z=2)
            >>> assert p.x == 0
            >>> assert p.y == 4
            >>> assert p.z == 2
        
        In addition to supplying the field names as an iterable of 2-tuples,
        you can also specify a mapping. The keys will be the field names, and
        the values will be the per-field default values. This is most useful
        with an OrderedDict, as the order of the fields will then be
        deterministic.  The module variable NO_DEFAULT can be specified if you
        want a field to use the per-type default value instead of specifying
        it with a field::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', OrderedDict((('x', 0),
            ...                                         ('y', NO_DEFAULT),
            ...                                         ('z', 0),
            ...                                         )),
            ...                            default=4)
            >>> p = Point(z=2)
            >>> assert p.x == 0
            >>> assert p.y == 4
            >>> assert p.z == 2
        
        Writing to values
        -----------------
        
        Instances of the classes generated by namedlist.namedlist are fully
        writable, unlike the tuple-derived classes returned by
        collections.namedtuple or namedlist.namedtuple::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y')
            >>> p = Point(1, 2)
            >>> p.y = 4
            >>> assert p.x == 1
            >>> assert p.y == 4
        
        
        Specifying __slots__
        --------------------
        
        For namedlist.namedlist, by default, the returned class sets __slots__
        which is initialized to the field names. While this decreases memory
        usage by eliminating the instance dict, it also means that you cannot
        create new instance members.
        
        To change this behavior, specify use_slots=False when creating the
        namedlist::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y', use_slots=False)
            >>> p = Point(0, 1)
            >>> p.z = 2
            >>> assert p.x == 0
            >>> assert p.y == 1
            >>> assert p.z == 2
        
        However, note that this method does not add the new variable to
        _fields, so it is not recognized when iterating over the instance::
        
            >>> list(p)
            [0, 1]
            >>> sorted(p._asdict().items())
            [('x', 0), ('y', 1)]
        
        
        Additional class members
        ------------------------
        
        namedlist.namedlist and namedlist.namedtuple classes contain these members:
        
        * _asdict(): Returns a dict which maps field names to their
          corresponding values.
        
        * _fields: Tuple of strings listing the field names. Useful for introspection.
        
        
        Renaming invalid field names
        ----------------------------
        
        This functionality is identical to collections.namedtuple. If you
        specify rename=True, then any invalid field names are changed to _0,
        _1, etc. Reasons for a field name to be invalid are:
        
        * Zero length strings.
        
        * Containing characters other than alphanumerics and underscores.
        
        * A conflict with a Python reserved identifier.
        
        * Beginning with a digit.
        
        * Beginning with an underscore.
        
        * Using the same field name more than once.
        
        For example::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x x for', rename=True)
            >>> assert Point._fields == ('x', '_1', '_2')
        
        
        Mutable default values
        ----------------------
        
        For namedlist.namelist, be aware of specifying mutable default
        values. Due to the way Python handles default values, each instance of
        a namedlist will share the default. This is especially problematic
        with default values that are lists. For example::
        
            >>> A = namedlist('A', [('x', [])])
            >>> a = A()
            >>> a.x.append(4)
            >>> b = A()
            >>> assert b.x == [4]
        
        This is probably not the desired behavior, so see the next section.
        
        
        Specifying a factory function for default values
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        For namedlist.namedlist, you can supply a zero-argument callable for a
        default, by wrapping it in a FACTORY call. The only change in this
        example is to change the default from `[]` to `FACTORY(list)`. But
        note that `b.x` is a new list object, not shared with `a.x`::
        
            >>> from namedlist import FACTORY
            >>> A = namedlist('A', [('x', FACTORY(list))])
            >>> a = A()
            >>> a.x.append(4)
            >>> b = A()
            >>> assert b.x == []
        
        Every time a new instance is created, your callable (in this case,
        `list`), will be called to produce a new instance for the default
        value.
        
        Iterating over instances
        ------------------------
        
        Because instances are iterable (like lists or tuples), iteration works
        the same way. Values are returned in definition order::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y z t')
            >>> p = Point(1.0, 42.0, 3.14, 2.71828)
            >>> for value in p:
            ...    print(value)
            1.0
            42.0
            3.14
            2.71828
        
        
        namedlist specific functions
        ============================
        
        _update
        -------
        
        `namedlist._update()` is similar to `dict.update()`. It is used to
        mutate a namedlist.namedlist instance with new values::
        
            >>> Point = namedlist('Point', 'x y z')
            >>> p = Point(1, 2, 3)
            >>> p.z = 4
            >>> p._update(y=5, x=6)
            >>> p
            Point(x=6, y=5, z=4)
        
            >>> p._update({'x': 7, 'z': 8})
            >>> p
            Point(x=7, y=5, z=8)
        
            >>> p._update([('z', 9), ('y', 10)])
            >>> p
            Point(x=7, y=10, z=9)
        
        
        Creating and using instances
        ============================
        
        Because the type returned by namedlist or namedtuple is a normal
        Python class, you create instances as you would with any Python class.

        1.7 2015-05-15 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Changed RPM name to python3-namedlist if running with python 3.
        
        * No code changes.
        
        1.6 2014-12-23 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Add namedlist._update(), similar to dict.update(). Thanks to Arthur
          Skowronek (issue #23).
        
        * Add namedlist._replace(), similar to namedtuple._replace (issue
          #24).
        
        1.5 2014-05-20 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Support slices in namedlist.__getattr__ (issue #22).
        
        1.4 2014-03-14 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Add MANIFEST.in to MANIFEST.in, so it will be included in sdists
          (issue #21).
        
        1.3 2014-03-12 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Support unicode type and field names in Python 2.x (issue #19). The
          identifiers still must be ASCII only, but you can pass them as
          unicode. This is useful for code that needs to run under both Python
          2 and Python 3.
        
        1.2 2014-02-13 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Produce an RPM named python-namedlist (issue #17).
        
        * Add namedtuple (issue #10). Passes all of the collections.namedtuple
          tests, except those related to _source. Those tests don't apply
          given our different approach to dynamic class creation. All other
          collections.namedtuple tests have been copied to our test suite.
        
        1.1 2014-02-07 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Added __dict__ so vars() will be supported.
        
        * Fixed pickling from another module (issue #14).
        
        * Moved tests to a separate file (issue #15).
        
        1.0 2014-02-04 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Declare the API stable and release version 1.0.
        
        * Support python 2.6 (issue #8). The doctests don't pass because
          OrderedDict isn't available until 2.7.
        
        0.4 2014-02-04 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Add docstring (issue #7).
        
        * Fixed README.txt typos (thanks pombredanne on bitbucket).
        
        0.3 2014-01-29 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Removed documentation left over from recordtype.
        
        * Make instances unhashable (issue #2).
        
        * For python3, use str.isidentifier (issue #1).
        
        * Reorganize code for name checking. No functional changes.
        
        * Make instances iterable (issue #3).
        
        * Add collections.Sequence ABC (issue #4).
        
        * Have "python setup.py test" also run doctests (issue #5).
        
        0.2 2014-01-28 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Added MANIFEST.in.
        
        * Hopefully fixed a problem with .rst formatting in CHANGES.txt.
        
        0.1 2014-01-28 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        
        * Initial release.
        
        * Based off my recordtype project, but uses ast generation instead of
          building up a string and exec-ing it. This has a number of advantages:
        
          - Supporting both python2 and python3 is easier. exec has the
            anti-feature of having different syntax in the two languages.
        
          - Adding additional features is easier, because I can write in real
            Python instead of having to write the string version, and deal
            with all of the escaping and syntax errors.
        
        * Added FACTORY, to allow namedlist to work even with mutable defaults.
